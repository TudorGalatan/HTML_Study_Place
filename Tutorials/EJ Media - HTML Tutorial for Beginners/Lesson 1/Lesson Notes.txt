- Lesson 1 - Introduction to HTML:

	- HTML:
		
		- It is a very important language for web development.
		- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
		- HTML is just a document that contains text.
		- Web browsers read and display documents that contain HTML.
		- To write HTML, you just need a text editor.
		- Examples of text editors to use:
			- Notepad
			- Notepad++
			- Visual Studio Code
			- Adobe Dreamweaver
		
	- Tags:

		- All tags are written between angle brackets.
		
		- Structure of a tag:
			<tag>
		
		- Structure of an opening tag:
			<tag>
			
		- Example of an opening tag:
			<body>
			
		- Structure of a closing tag:
			<tag>
			
		- Example of a closing tag:
			</body>
			
	- Markup element:

		- It is a pair of an opening and a closing tag, with some content inbetween.
		
		- All opening tags have a closing tag too.
		
		- Structure:
			<tag>content</tag>
		
		- Example:
			<body>This is a line of text.</body>
			
	- Empty element:

		- It is a type of element that doesn't have a closing tag.
		
		- Structure:
			<tag />
			
		- Example:
			<br />
				- This is a line break.
				- It just creates a line break, there is no content to put between an opening
				  tag and a closing one, so there is no need of a closing tag.
